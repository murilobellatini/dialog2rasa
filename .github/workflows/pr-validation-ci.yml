# This is a CI workflow for validating pull requests by running tests.
# It triggers on PRs to the main branch, sets up a Python environment,
# installs dependencies with Poetry, and runs tests using pytest.
# Test results are uploaded as artifacts for review.
# This ensures that all code merged into main passes necessary quality checks.
